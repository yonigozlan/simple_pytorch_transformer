# Pytorch implementation of the "Transformer"

This work is a simple implementation of the model described in the seminal paper [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

The model is implemented in Pytorch and is tested on a translation task from English to German and from German to English.


This implementation uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as package and dependency manager.



*This work is inspired by [Harvard NLP annotated transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/)*
